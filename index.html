        <h1>The Terra Ignotta Dice Game</h1>

        <h2>What is this?</h2>
        <p>This is a fanmade dice game based on the Terra Ignotta series by Doctor Ada Palmer. It's designed to be played with 5 to eight players, in 20 to 40 minutes, with a focus on assymetric gameplay, discussion, and negotiation.</p>

        <h2>Should I be familiar with the books?</h2>
        <p>It is not necessary, though you'll probably enjoy things more if you've read all of the books. The game's rules do not directly mention anything that specifically happens in the plot, but they are certainly suggestive of how things go, so if you wish to go in with no risk of being spoiled, <b>I suggest you do not play this game.</b></p>

        <h2>What do I need to play?</h2>
        <p>In person, you can play this game with 5 to 8 people (more will generally be better), an eight sided dice, a piece of paper and something to write with. If you use this website, all you need is the people and a way for them to communicate with each other.</p>
